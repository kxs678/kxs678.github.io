        <h2>Sharkwrecked at Riptide Music Festival</h2>
          <p>The rock alternative scene is very much alive in South Florida, as 104.3 proved Saturday at the first Riptide Music Festival. Positioned on Fort Lauderdale Beach, many concert goers wore their beach clothes and dug their toes (and Coronas) in the sand. The venue was packed all the way to the edge of the shore, and even the beach-goers of the day were hanging on the outside fence, trying to soak in some free music.

            <p>Spring break is in full swing, and my first adventure was going to Tampa for the first day of Gasparilla Music Festival on Saturday, 3/11. My car seemed to have different plans as it tried to blow up twice—but I was determined to make it there to see Cage the Elephant that night. After willing my car not to overheat, I made it to Tampa for the first time ever and was pleased to see that Gasparilla Music Festival did a great job highlighting what its city had to offer beyond an epic Grammy-winning headliner...<a href="http://www.wvum.org/gasparilla-music-festival-recap/" target="_blank"><strong>Read More</strong></a></p>
